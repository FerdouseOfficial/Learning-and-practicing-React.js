/**
 * Actually import and export divided into 2 part okay 
 *  1 is defaulth export 
 *      inside of default export we just write export then defaulth then the var name and call it where we want it with different names or what ever we want okay
 *  2 is named export
 *      but in name export we need to write export just before the var
 *      then if we want to access it into other file we have to call it this way    import {the exact var name} from the file name this way. okay
 * 
 * I hope you under it
